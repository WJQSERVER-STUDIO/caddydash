## üí° Architecture Overview

CaddyDash frontend adopts a **Multi-Page Application (MPA)** architecture, where each main functional module corresponds to an independent HTML page, driven by its dedicated JavaScript entry file.

*   **Highly Modular**: All JavaScript code is organized in **ESM (ECMAScript Modules)** form, enabling code reuse and separation of concerns through `import/export` mechanisms.
*   **Shared Components**: Modules like `js/common.js`, `js/locale.js`, `js/notifications.js`, `js/ui.js`, `js/api.js` encapsulate functionalities shared across pages, such as page initialization, internationalization, notifications, UI operations, and backend API calls.
*   **Independent Page Logic**: `js/app.js` (site configuration), `js/global.js` (global configuration), `js/settings.js` (panel settings), `js/login.js` (login), `js/init.js` (initialization) handle their respective page-specific business logic.

## üåê Internationalization (i18n)

CaddyDash frontend supports multi-language display.

*   **Language Packs**: Translation texts are stored in `locales/en.json` (English) and `locales/zh-CN.json` (Simplified Chinese) files.
*   **Dynamic Translation**: The `js/locale.js` module is responsible for loading the correct language pack and dynamically translating texts within HTML elements that have `data-i18n` (content), `data-i18n-title` (title attribute), and `data-i18n-placeholder` (input placeholder) attributes.
*   **Switching Languages**: On the login page, initialization page, or panel settings page, you can change the language through the language toggle options in the interface.

**How to add new translation entries:**

1.  Add new key-value pairs to `locales/en.json` and `locales/zh-CN.json`. Please follow the existing dot-separated naming convention (e.g., `pages.feature.new_text`).
2.  In HTML, use `data-i18n="your.new.key"`, `data-i18n-title="your.new.key"`, or `data-i18n-placeholder="your.new.key"` attributes.
3.  In JavaScript code, use the `t('your.new.key', { replacements })` function to retrieve translated text.
